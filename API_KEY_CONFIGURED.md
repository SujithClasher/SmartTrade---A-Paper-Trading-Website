## 💡 API Usage Tips

### Free Tier Limits:
- **60 API calls per minute**
- **Our app is optimized to stay within limits** ✅
- Request queue prevents rate limiting
- Smart caching reduces calls

### Best Practices:
1. Don't refresh too frequently (built-in protection)
2. Search with 2+ characters (reduces waste)
3. Limited to 6 top movers (optimized)
4. Cache works for 2-10 minutes

### If You Hit Limits:
- **Rarely happens** with our optimizations
- App falls back to cached data
- No errors shown to user
- Automatic retry after 1 minute
